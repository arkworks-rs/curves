Implementing [Bendersnatch curve](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-bandersnatch-a-fast-elliptic-curve-built-over-the-bls12-381-scalar-field/9957) using [Arkwork](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/curves)'s framework in Rust.

See [here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/blob/main/README.md) for 
the Spec of the curve.

There was also a Python implementation [here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/).
